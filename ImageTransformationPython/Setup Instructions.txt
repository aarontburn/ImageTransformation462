Installation info for the Python side



Dependencies that are used within the project are stored in the 'requirements.txt', 
which is auto-generated by the library 'pipreqs' to store dependencies.


- Initialize environment
    - Install virtual environment
        To setup the python virtual environment, cd into the Python projects' root directory ('./ImageTransformationPython/")
        and run the following command:

            python -m venv ./.venv


        A folder should be added named '.venv'. This folder should not be pushed to the GitHub repository and is already ignored
        by the '.gitignore'.

    - Activate virtual environment
        To activate the virtual environment (Windows), run the command (from the python root directory ('./ImageTransformationPython/")):

            .\.venv\Scripts\activate


        If this is done successfully, the start of the line should be prefixed with '(.venv)'

        To return to a normal terminal, run the command:
            deactivate


- Dependency Installation
    To install dependencies used, cd into the Python projects' root directory ('./ImageTransformationPython/")
    and run the following command:

        pip install -r ./src/requirements.txt


- Dependency storing
    If you used any other external libraries from pip, please store them within the 'requirements.txt'
    file. 

    To do this, first install pipreqs using:

        pip install pipreqs


    Then, cd into the 'src' folder ('./ImageTransformationPython/src/) and run the command:

        pipreqs --force

    This will generate/update a 'requirements.txt' file in the 'src' directory.
