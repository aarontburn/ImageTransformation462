Installation info for the Python side



Dependencies that are used within the project are stored in the 'requirements.txt', 
which is auto-generated by the library 'pipreqs' to store dependencies.


- Dependency Installation
To install dependencies used, cd into the root directory ('./ImageTransformationPython/")
and run the following command:

    pip install -r ./src/requirements.txt


- Dependency storing
If you used any other external libraries from pip, please store them within the 'requirements.txt'
file. 

To do this, first install pipreqs using:

    pip install pipreqs


Then, cd into the 'src' folder ('./ImageTransformationPython/src/) and run the command:

    pipreqs --force
